# TIS-100 Solutions 🖥️

This repository contains my solutions to puzzles from **TIS-100**, a programming game by Zachtronics focused on low-level computation and parallel processing.

TIS-100 simulates a fictional assembly-like machine composed of interconnected processing nodes. Each puzzle requires writing programs under strict constraints (instruction count, node usage, cycle limits).

## 🎯 Objectives

This repository exists to:

- Strengthen low-level reasoning
- Practice parallel program design
- Explore optimization trade-offs (cycles vs nodes vs instructions)
- Improve structured, constraint-driven thinking
