# TIS-100 Solutions 🖥️

This repository contains my solutions to puzzles from **TIS-100**, a programming game by Zachtronics focused on low-level computation and parallel processing.

TIS-100 simulates a fictional assembly-like machine composed of interconnected processing nodes. Each puzzle requires writing programs under strict constraints (instruction count, node usage, cycle limits).

Note that the node numbers indicate the boxes and is read from left to right (i.e. 0 to 4 on the first row, 5 to 8 on the second etc.).

## 🎯 Objectives

This repository exists to:

- Strengthen low-level reasoning
- Practice parallel program design
- Explore optimization trade-offs (cycles vs nodes vs instructions)
- Improve structured, constraint-driven thinking
